```
$ npm i lotr-movie-sdk
```

## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>
You need to create an instance of the `MovieSDK` class. The `MovieSDK` instance must be instantiated with your `clientSecret` and `clientKey`. We have provided test credentials for both which are used below:
```javascript
import MovieSDK from 'lotr-movie-sdk/api';
import { MovieConfiguration, MovieIDObject } from 'lotr-movie-sdk/types';
const movieConfig: MovieConfiguration = {
    clientSecret: 'abcd',
    clientKey: '1234'
};
const movie = new MovieSDK(movieConfig);
```
This SDK has some typescript types and interfaces defined to make development easy for you.

## Get All Movies <a name="get-all-movies"></a>
```javascript
const movies = await movie.getAll();
console.log(movies);
```
The above code snippet would output something like the following:
```json
[
            {
                "_id": "5cd95395de30eff6ebccde56",
                "name": "The Lord of the Rings Series",
                "runtimeInMinutes": 558,
                "budgetInMillions": 281,
                "boxOfficeRevenueInMillions": 2917,
                "academyAwardNominations": 30,
                "academyAwardWins": 17,
                "rottenTomatoesScore": 94
            },
            {
                "_id": "5cd95395de30eff6ebccde57",
                "name": "The Hobbit Series",
                "runtimeInMinutes": 462,
                "budgetInMillions": 675,
                "boxOfficeRevenueInMillions": 2932,
                "academyAwardNominations": 7,
                "academyAwardWins": 1,
                "rottenTomatoesScore": 66.33333333
            }
        ]
```
## Get Movies By ID <a name="get-by-id"></a>
```javascript
const movieIDObj: MovieIDObject = {
      id: req.params.id
};
const movie = await movie.getById(movieIDObj);
console.log(movie);
```
The above code would output a response that looks the following:
```json
[
            {
                "_id": "5cd95395de30eff6ebccde56",
                "name": "The Lord of the Rings Series",
                "runtimeInMinutes": 558,
                "budgetInMillions": 281,
                "boxOfficeRevenueInMillions": 2917,
                "academyAwardNominations": 30,
                "academyAwardWins": 17,
                "rottenTomatoesScore": 94
            }
]
```

## Get Movie Quotes <a name="get-movie-quotes"></a>
```javascript
const movieIDObj: MovieIDObject = {
      id: req.params.id
    };
const movieQuotes = await movie.getQuotes(movieIDObj);
console.log(movieQuotes);
```
The above code snippet would result in a response that looks like the following:
```json
[
            {
                "_id": "5cd96e05de30eff6ebcce7e9",
                "dialog": "Deagol!",
                "movie": "5cd95395de30eff6ebccde5d",
                "character": "5cd99d4bde30eff6ebccfe9e",
                "id": "5cd96e05de30eff6ebcce7e9"
            },
            {
                "_id": "5cd96e05de30eff6ebcce7ea",
                "dialog": "Deagol!",
                "movie": "5cd95395de30eff6ebccde5d",
                "character": "5cd99d4bde30eff6ebccfe9e",
                "id": "5cd96e05de30eff6ebcce7ea"
            },
        ]
```
